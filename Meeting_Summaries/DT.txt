**4. Executive Summary:**
Donald Trump has revealed plans for a $175 billion missile defense system called the "Golden Dome," designed to intercept attacks from space. Critics question the feasibility of completing the project by 2029, citing the complexity of the technology and the scale compared to Israel's Iron Dome.

**5. Main Topics Discussed:**

*   **Trump's "Golden Dome" Missile Defense System:** Design to intercept attacks from space.
*   **Future-Proofing the US:** The plan aims to protect against potential attacks from adversaries using advanced missile technology, including space-based weapons.
*   **Technical Challenges:** The project faces significant technological hurdles, particularly in deploying hardware into space.
*   **Feasibility Concerns:** Critics doubt that the system can be fully implemented within Trump's stated timeline of three and a half years.
*   **Comparison to Israel's Iron Dome:** The "Golden Dome" is seen as an ambitious expansion of the Iron Dome concept, but the scale and technological demands are vastly different.

## Full Transcript

Speaker 1: A US President Donald Trump has unveiled the design for a new missile defense system for the United States, that he's calling the Golden Dome. He said it would be able to intercept attacks, launched from space, and claimed it would be up and running before he leaves office in 2029. The president said the final cost of the project would be $175 billion. North America correspondent Peter Vose told me more about the proposal.

Speaker 2: This is Donald Trump's plan to essentially future-proof the United States from potential attacks from its adversaries, and it is looking ahead, it is looking at the potential developments in terms of missile technology and the way that the United States could be attacked from targets that are pointed out from the earth and from space. And that's the significant difference. This United States may be traditional in a certain sense, but the way in which the adversaries will use technology with weapons that essentially fired from space is going to be the future. And you'll get many defense experts who say that this is how Donald Trump, another world leader, should be looking at defense for the future. The big question is, is Donald Trump being overly ambitious? This seems to be molded on Israel's iron dome, which of course is designed and has been used for some time now to prevent short range attacks in a relatively small country. The United States is of course very different. This is a vast expanse of land, at least mainland America, and the technology required, especially to get the hardware into space, is going to be tremendously sophisticated, and some critics say that President Trump won't be able to achieve it in the three and a half years that he's spelled out.
